# Surfaces decisions

Each entry: the date, the stage, the choice, the reason. Owner decisions are marked (owner).

- 2026-10-21, plan: build in Flare first, document for Prism Terminal, port after (owner).
- 2026-10-21, plan: the agent must be able to USE surfaces, not only show them, modelled on the iOS
  simulator MCP (describe, tap, type, screenshot) (owner).
- 2026-10-21, plan: video must play at full frame rate, so web content is a real WebView2 panel, not
  frames drawn into the grid (owner: "it can't just be a frame here and there").
- 2026-10-21, plan: one panel per tab in v1; more later.

## Stage 1: panels (`surfaces-1-panels`, issues #15 and #16)

- 2026-10-21, stage 1, chords: **Ctrl+Shift+P** shows or hides the front tab's panel, **Ctrl+Shift+O** moves the
  keys between the terminal and the panel. Why: a program cannot tell Ctrl+Shift+letter from Ctrl+letter in the
  legacy key encoding, so no shell or agent loses a key it could have used; plain Ctrl+P and Ctrl+O stay the
  shell's. P is "panel"; O is "the other side". Both are always the app's (rule 7: a host chord never reaches the
  pty), so with no panel to bring back, or none open, they do nothing and the shell does not hear them (a ^P would
  walk the shell's history). A chord with Alt too (AltGr on some layouts) is the shell's.
  Both live in the one chord table (`flare-tabs` `keymap.rs`, rule 7), and the table's own tests cover them.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, focus: a panel never takes the keys by itself (a click on a link leaves them in the
  terminal). A click in the panel, or Ctrl+Shift+O, gives it the keys; Esc, or the chord again, gives them back.
  While the panel has the keys a key that is no chord goes to Slint (the panel scrolls with the arrows, Page
  keys, Home and End; Enter or Space zooms a picture), never to the shell. Closing the panel, or leaving its tab,
  while it has the keys returns them to the terminal at once. Why: typing into the wrong place is the worst
  thing a split view can do.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, state file: **`panels.json` beside `tabs.json`**, not inside it. Why: `tabs.json`'s key
  order is a shape other code depends on, and a panel is not a tab property that must survive a downgrade. A tab
  has no id across a restart, so an entry carries its folder and is matched to a restored tab by folder, in
  order (`match_restored`); a tab dropped from the restore only skips its entry. The file has a `version`. It is
  written the way `tabs.json` is (temp file, rename, 400 ms debounce, synchronous flush at close; rules 36 and
  41). The writer thread is made on the first save, and a session that never opens a panel writes no file.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, what is stored: kind, target, open, width (the share of the page). A closed panel keeps
  its kind and target so the toggle chord can bring it back; it holds no picture and no rows. Unknown kinds are
  dropped on load; a kind this build cannot draw yet (web, changes, tasks, board, mod) is kept in memory and in
  the file and is not shown. A width that is not a fraction reads as "not set" and the default applies, it is never
  written back as a number (rule 40). A stored target is re-checked like a click: a local drive path, no NUL, no
  network path (it would make Windows reach out), a name of the stored kind.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, layout numbers (all in `flare-surfaces` `layout.rs`, handed to the window once):
  default share 40 percent of the page; the slot is at least 240 css px unless the page cannot give it so much;
  the terminal always keeps 320 css px; the slot is at most 70 percent; under 120 css px of room the slot is not
  shown (the panel stays open in the model, and the terminal keeps the whole page); the splitter's hit area is 8
  css px centred on the slot's left edge; the header is 32 css px. Why 320: about 40 columns, the least a prompt
  stays readable in. The `.slint` file evaluates the same formulas in logical pixels with `Px.snap`; a test pins
  the two to each other at all eight scales, five widths and four shares, and a probe reports both.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, one fit (rule 24): while the splitter moves, the slot follows the pointer and the grid
  keeps its width (the slot is drawn over it, opaque); the share is stored on the release and the grid fits
  once. The held-width trick of the sidebar's slide is not reused: it freezes the whole page, and here only the
  slot moves.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, previews: a plain left click on a path link asks a worker to resolve the path again (rule
  13), and the app shows it in the panel only when the file is on the click allowlist (`may_open`) as named AND as
  the file system names it, and both names are of the same previewable kind (`classify_resolved`). So a link
  called `a.png` that points at `run.exe` is revealed, not shown. Pictures: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, webp, ico.
  Text: txt, md, markdown, rst, log, json, jsonc, yaml, yml, toml, csv, tsv, ini, cfg, conf, xml, lock, diff, patch,
  rs, ts, tsx, c, h, cpp, hpp, cc, cs, go, java, kt, swift, css, scss, sql, slint, vue, svelte. Not svg (a vector
  file can carry script and is not in the picture list), not pdf, not any script (rule 14). Folders and
  everything else keep today's behaviour. The right-click menu's Open still hands the file to Windows: that is an
  explicit ask. The setting is **Open previews in Flare** (`flare.window.openPreviews`, default on) in a new
  **Links** section of Settings > Terminal; no page held link behaviour before.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, pictures: decoded on a worker with the `image` crate (png, jpeg, gif, bmp, webp, ico; the
  rest of its formats are off). Limits: a 64 MB file, 100 megapixels, and a side over 8192 px is scaled down
  (a GPU texture limit). The decoded bytes go into a Slint pixel buffer on the worker, so the UI thread copies
  nothing. A GIF shows its first frame. Fitted: never enlarged, kept in shape, centred; a click shows one image
  pixel per device pixel with scrolling; a click again fits it. A small picture is shown as it is and a click does
  nothing. A picture with any transparent pixel sits on a checkerboard (a tiled 16 px tile, two neutral greys).
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, text: read on a worker, first 4 MB, 100 000 lines, 2000 characters a line (a longer line is cut
  with a mark); tabs are four spaces; bytes that are not UTF-8 show as replacement marks; a NUL in the first 8 KB
  means "This file is not text." and a missing, denied or unreadable file shows its reason in the panel, never a
  blank. Monospace (Cascadia Mono), a line-number gutter, only the rows in view are built (100 000 lines draw in
  milliseconds), no wrapping, a horizontal scroll, no selection and no copy yet (v1 is a viewer). A cut file says
  so in a line under the text.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, one panel per tab; only the front tab's is loaded. A tab behind keeps its path and reads it
  again when it comes to the front (no cache: a file may have changed, and memory stays flat). A newer click
  replaces the panel; an answer for an older one is dropped by a generation number.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, the overlay flag: one `out` property of the window, `overlay-open`, the OR of every overlay:
  menu, tab list, dialog, update window, update notice, the Settings page in front, Settings dropdown, theme
  editor, theme question, Dictation question, colour picker, Command help, find bar, the F12 diagnostics card and a
  tab being dragged (its ghost crosses the page; added after the stage 1 review). `flare-surfaces`
  `overlay::Overlay::ALL` names them; a test opens each and checks the flag; the match in that test has no
  catch-all arm, so a new overlay cannot be added without being counted; another test reads the property's line
  from `app.slint` and counts its terms. Native panels ignore the flag (Slint orders them with the rest); stage 3's
  web panel hides while it is true. The find bar spans the terminal only, so it never overlaps the slot, but it
  counts (it is one of the overlays the task names). The Copied badge and tooltips are not counted: they are small
  and brief; stage 3 should check them against a child window.

### Stage 1 review fixes (2026-10-21)

- 2026-10-21, stage 1, rule 36: `panels.json` is flushed with the other stores at logoff, shutdown and quit. The
  window keeps a handle to the `PanelStore` and one function (`flush_stores`) writes all four, for the session-end
  closure and for the end of `run`; a test holds that a change still inside its debounce lands on the disk.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, a click on the file already on show reads it again. A panel that never re-read would show a
  log the agent has since rewritten, and a file that first failed could never be retried. The old content stays on
  show until the new read answers (no flash of "Opening").
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, one picture decodes at a time, and a decode the user has left stops. A shared "newest
  generation" number is checked before the decode, between decode and resize, and before the answer is posted; a
  mutex lets one decode run at once. A decode at the 100 megapixel limit is about 400 MB, so several at once was
  the real danger. The decoded image is turned into RGBA by value (no clone) and dropped as soon as the pixel buffer
  has its copy.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, every load is vetted the way a click is, including a target restored from `panels.json`: the
  worker canonicalises it, both names must be on the click allowlist and of the same kind, and the real name must be
  a local drive path. A mapped drive (which canonicalises to a network name) or a link that now points at another
  kind is refused with "not allowed". A missing file still says "The file is gone."
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, text files: a UTF-16 file with a BOM (what Windows PowerShell 5.1 writes for redirection) is
  decoded as UTF-16, a UTF-8 BOM is dropped, and only then does a NUL in the first 8 KB mean "not text". The header
  shows the file's real length, and the foot names the cap that cut it ("Only the first 4.0 MB are shown." or "Only
  the first 100000 lines are shown.").
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, the rows and the widest line are built on the worker; the UI thread wraps them in a model.
- 2026-10-21, stage 1, Ctrl+Shift+P on a panel of a kind this build cannot draw (web, changes, tasks, board, mod,
  restored from the file) does nothing and leaves the stored entry alone, so the chord never flips an invisible state.

- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: the channel is two crates, `flare-ctl` (protocol, grants, framing, the
  connection state machine, the pipe, the client) and `flare-mcp` (a client binary). Neither depends on
  anything of the app, so the same contract ports to Prism Terminal and the MCP binary can be shared.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: the connection logic (`session.rs`) is written against a `Wire` trait and
  the Windows pipe is one implementation, so every error path is tested in memory and the real pipe has
  its own round-trip tests. A port implements the same state machine over `net.Socket`.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: reads are non-blocking probes plus a 1 to 10 ms sleep, never a parked
  `ReadFile`. A synchronous Windows handle serialises its calls, so a parked read would hold out every
  writer on the same handle (events, replies). Cost: an idle client wakes about 100 times a second on
  its own worker thread; the UI thread never waits (rule 34).
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: only the connection's own worker thread writes to its pipe. Events the
  app publishes wait in a per-connection outbox (256, drop oldest) and are written between requests and
  while idle. A client that never reads can only stall its own worker, never the app.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: the dispatcher runs on a short-lived thread per request so a hung handler
  cannot hold a connection past its timeout (15 s, 60 s for `browser.*`). Only handlers past their
  timeout count as stuck (a three-state flag per call); past 32 new calls answer `unavailable`.
  (Review fix: the first version counted every in-flight call, which would have refused 33 legitimate
  concurrent `browser.wait`s.)
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: the grant is re-read on every request, not only at hello. This makes
  "a disabled mod's token is dead" (S5) true for open connections, and makes the user's eval switch live.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: grants are a pure function (`Grant::may_call`) over an exhaustive method
  enum. Adding a method is a compile error until its namespace, timeout and grant are decided. The `ui`
  grant is in-process only and is never issued over the pipe.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: `shell.input`, `settings.set` and `mods.enable` exist as reserved method
  names that every pipe grant is refused, only so the S3 refusal is a pinned test rather than an absence.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: the pipe name is `flare-ctl-<FNV-1a of SID>` with an optional scope hash,
  and `FLARE_CTL_PIPE` overrides it for clients. A scope keeps an e2e run (own profile) off the owner's
  running Flare, as the single-instance pipe already does.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: framing errors that mean the peer is broken (not JSON, not a request,
  over 16 MB, bad token) close that connection after one error line; mistakes a well-formed client can
  make (unknown method, forbidden, bad params, rate limit) leave it open.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: `flare-mcp` is hand-rolled on `serde_json` (four JSON-RPC methods, about
  300 lines). No MCP crate: nothing to audit, no new dependency, nothing to keep in step with the spec.
  Argument mistakes are tool errors (`isError`) so the model sees them; unknown tools are JSON-RPC errors.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: relative paths are made absolute in `flare-mcp` (the agent's cwd), then
  re-resolved by Flare (S2). Flare's own cwd for a tab is not the agent's.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library: not yet wired. flare.exe does not start the server, the shells do not get
  `FLARE_TAB_ID`/`FLARE_CTL_PIPE` from this crate, the `flare-status` plugin manifest does not list
  `flare-mcp`, and the pack script does not ship it. That is stage 2 proper, after the panels land.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library review fixes: the library refuses a `ui` grant from the app over the
  pipe (token: `unauthorized`, agent: `internal`) and refuses `ui`-namespace methods whatever the grant.
  The app is trusted to decide grants, but a single app-side bug must not open `shell.input` to a
  socket, so the wire layer does not rely on it.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library review fixes: every request takes a rate token before the app is asked
  anything (including `unknown_method`, `forbidden` and `hello` retries). Cost: `hello` spends one of
  the 200 burst tokens. Gain: a spammer cannot drive unlimited grant callbacks into the app.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library review fixes: stopping the server cancels blocked pipe writes
  (`CancelIoEx` from the stopping thread, repeated until the workers are out), makes waiting calls
  answer `unavailable` within 50 ms, and returns how many handler threads are still running. Rule 28:
  nothing that calls into the app may outlive teardown unnoticed; the app waits on the count inside
  its quit cap and the handlers are told (in the `Dispatcher` docs) to return quickly after stop.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library review fixes: queued events are written only between whole messages
  (never while half a request line is buffered), otherwise a 4 MB `view.text` request against more
  than 64 KB of queued events deadlocks both sides on full pipe buffers.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library review fixes: the tab of a connection is advisory and grants are not a
  sandbox against the user's own processes (the agent has Bash as that user). Methods act on
  `ctx.tab` only. Written into protocol.md section 4 so a port does not read S3 as enforced by the
  channel.
- 2026-10-21, stage 2 library review fixes: `flare-mcp` waits for a call as long as the method's server
  timeout plus 5 s; a fixed 20 s dropped the connection on a legitimate 60 s `browser.wait`.
